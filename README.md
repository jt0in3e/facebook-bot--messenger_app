## ðŸ™Œ Main functionality

It works in two derection:
1. you could send commands to messenger-bot by starting conversation with the Page,
or 
2. post status [post] in the Page with text consisting of some commangs.



### Using messenger

Go to [Page](https://www.facebook.com/Event-make-bot-Community-1352106568187457/?fref=nf) and start conversetion with messenger or start conversation from you chat by finding the bot -> 'Event-make-bot-Community'.

Bot understands the following command:

>    **/event**                  --> *creates event for the current date {not fb-event but 'event' with its own database/mongodb/ and own managment process} and adds user to this event; post text as the Page status saying about creation of event and adding of user*
     
>   **/list**                      -->  *checks whether event exists and shows/lists all users added to the event*
    
>   **/registered**         --> *cheks whether event exists and shows how many users registered [count]*

>    **/remove** [or] "**-**"  --> *checks whether event exists and remove registered user; sends comment to the main status of event saying that user is removed; updates count of registered and list of registered persons*

>    **/add** [or] "**+**"       --> *checks whether event exists and add user to event; sends comment to the main status of event saying that user is added; updates count of registered and list of registered persons*

>    **/help**               --> *display available commands*

>    [**other text**]    --> *bot respones that command is not understandable*



### Creating event thought the Page statuses / users posts

Go to the [Event-make-bot-Community Page](https://www.facebook.com/Event-make-bot-Community-1352106568187457/?fref=nf) and post you status with text consisting of current date {forman is DD/MM} and add sign '+' or number '1' or '+1'. 
E.g. "Lets get together today (30/11) in pub 'yeap-drink' and have fun. +1".
Fb-app/bot will scan this text and if no event, it will create event and add user to the event. 
Persons, who wants to be added to the event, could post comment with text '+' or '[number]' to the above status and will be registered to the event / added to the database /. If you want to be removed from event, post comment to the above status with text '-' and bot automaticaly will remove you.
List of registered persons and number/count of registered persons could be viewed throught messenger by sending commands to Event-make-bot-Community bot as '/list' and '/registered'
