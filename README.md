## ðŸ™Œ Main functionality

It works in two derection:
1. you could send commands to messenger-bot by starting conversation with the Page,
or 
2. post status [post] in the Page with text consisting of some commangs.



### Using messenger

Go to [Page](https://www.facebook.com/footballendpoint/) and start conversetion with messenger.
Bot understands the following command:

'''
    /event                  --> creates event for the current date {not fb-event but 'event' with its own database/mongodb/ and own managment process} and adds user to this event; post text as the Page status saying about creation of event and adding of user
'''

'''
    /list                      -->  checks whether event exists and shows/lists all users added to the event
'''

'''
    /registered         --> cheks whether event exists and shows how many users registered [count]
'''

'''
    /remove [or] "-"  --> checks whether event exists and remove registered user; sends comment to the main status of event saying that user is removed; updates count of registered and list of registered persons
'''

'''
    /add [or] "+"       --> checks whether event exists and add user to event; sends comment to the main status of event saying that user is added; updates count of registered and list of registered persons
'''

'''
    /help               --> display available commands
'''

'''
    [other text]    --> bot respones that command is not understandable
'''
